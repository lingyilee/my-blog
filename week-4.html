        <p>I will get started on my presentation.</p>

        <p>Are there any blockers?</p>

        <p>I thought I had more time, but I ended up spending a lot of time on the logo.</p>

        <p>Weekly Retrospectives Questions</p>

        <p>Week 3</p>

        <p>What went well:</p>
        
        <p>I feel like the presentation went smoothly, and I managed to finish my design strategy document, which I didn't think I would, so I'm happy about that. I also have a good idea about what to do with my Type Here brief, so I will focus on that next week.</p>
        
        <p>What didn't go well:</p>
        
        <p>Even though the delivery was what I wanted, I didn't end up selling my idea enough in the pitch presentation, so I will need to refine my presentation style and do better in the final one. Maybe I will watch some YouTube videos on how startups get their funding through their presentations.</p>
        
        <p>What can be improved:</p>
        
        <p>My presentation style. I need to get out of student mode somehow and try to be more confident in my ideas and really sell them to my audience. I think just by refining the words and gestures I use in my presentation, I can probably achieve that.</p>
        
        <p>What actions will I take for the next sprint:</p>
        
        <p>I want to start animating the letters for my Type Here poster, and then I will probably need to ask Simon for a tutorial on how to code the hover state function, so that the letters' animations start when I hover my cursor over them. Also, I want to refine and finalise my branding for Lotus & Fern. I really want to get this done in the first two or three days of the week, because I want to spend more time on my hi-fi prototype.</p>
