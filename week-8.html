        <p>Weekly Retrospectives Questions</p>

        <p>Week 8</p>

        <p>What went well:</p>
        
        <p>The presentation went smoothly and I got everything done on time – the lecturers liked the bright colours.
        </p>
        
        <p>What didn't go well:</p>
        
        <p>Again, not realising I had only uploaded and not submitted my Type Here poster was a big mistake.</p>
        
        <p>What can be improved:</p>
        
        <p>Always double check that your work is properly submitted on MyLearn. Also, to not look at the screen the whole time during a presentation and try to engage more with your audience; use more imagery in my slides; remember to keep in mind who your target audience is when designing your product; keep the slides to a minimum; and learn your own product thoroughly.</p>
        
        <p>What actions will I take for the next sprint:</p>
        
        <p>Go on holiday!</p>
