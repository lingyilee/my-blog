        <p>Weekly Retrospectives Questions</p>

        <p>Week 1</p>

        <p>What went well:</p>
        
        <p>Even though it was pointed out that my idea for the Social Enterprise brief has already been done in real life before, I feel like just deciding on something and doing research for it has helped me get my feet off the ground.
            Now, I plan on refining my area of interest for my social enterprise and start looking at tackling it from an alternative perspective, as Melody suggested.</p>
        
        <p>What didn't go well:</p>
        
        <p>I feel like after taking a two week break from tapping into my inner design brain, I have become slower at thinking and coming up with novel ideas. This is, again, probably because I haven't utilised that part of my brain in a hot minute.
            I also haven't accomplished my sprint goal yet, because I have been utilising my time doing other things, such as socialising, so I haven't spent the alocated time doing the required work.
            Also, I have only just put together my plan for this week and the rest of this semester yesterday, so I haven't exactly been following a plan yet.
        </p>
        
        <p>What can be improved:</p>
        
        <p>I think just having a clearer and more defined timeline will help me distribute my time in a more efficient way.
            I have learn that having small daily goals that are realistic and doable is vital to serving the bigger picture, which in this case is finishing this assignment/brief to a standard that I am proud of.</p>
        
        <p>What actions will I take for the next sprint:</p>
        
        <p>I will try to accomplish every daily task that I set for myself on time and see if it is realistic or not for me to keep up with.</p>

        <p>Week 2</p>

        <p>What went well:</p>
        
        <p>I feel like I got lots of work done. I mainly referenced the work I did last semester for the steps I needed to take and organised the steps accordingly. I also presented my first ever WIP, which I was happy about. I got good feedback, which I will be implementing into my work going forward.</p>
        
        <p>What didn't go well:</p>
        
        <p> I wouldn't say that it didn't go well, but some of the answers from my interviews were not what I expected and I found it hard to draw usable content out of the answers they gave. I also wished that I asked more than 10 questions, because I feel like it would have increased the chances of me getting more insight if I asked more questions.
        </p>
        
        <p>What can be improved:</p>
        
        <p>Next time I conduct an interview, I will ask more questions. I saw that all my other classmates had a lot more questions in their interviews, so maybe this is something I should do too.</p>
        
        <p>What actions will I take for the next sprint:</p>
        
        <p>I will try to finish everything on time and start with my wireframes and lo-fi prototypes next week.</p>
