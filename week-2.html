        <p>Weekly Retrospectives Questions</p>

        <p>Week 2</p>

        <p>What went well:</p>
        
        <p>I feel like I got lots of work done. I mainly referenced the work I did last semester for the steps I needed to take and organised the steps accordingly. I also presented my first ever WIP, which I was happy about. I got good feedback, which I will be implementing into my work going forward.</p>
        
        <p>What didn't go well:</p>
        
        <p> I wouldn't say that it didn't go well, but some of the answers from my interviews were not what I expected and I found it hard to draw usable content out of the answers they gave. I also wished that I asked more than 10 questions, because I feel like it would have increased the chances of me getting more insight if I asked more questions.
        </p>
        
        <p>What can be improved:</p>
        
        <p>Next time I conduct an interview, I will ask more questions. I saw that all my other classmates had a lot more questions in their interviews, so maybe this is something I should do too.</p>
        
        <p>What actions will I take for the next sprint:</p>
        
        <p>I will try to finish everything on time and start with my wireframes and lo-fi prototypes next week.</p>
