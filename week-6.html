        <p>Weekly Retrospectives Questions</p>

        <p>Week 3</p>

        <p>What went well:</p>
        
        <p>I managed to steadily conduct a good number of user testings and finish my styleguide quickly.</p>
        
        <p>What didn't go well:</p>
        
        <p>Being sick on Friday means that I will be pushing my WIP back to the next week, which could potentially make me behind on all the other tasks I still need to do, such as the Type Brief, case study, and creative media strategy.</p>
        
        <p>What can be improved:</p>
        
        <p>I think I can improve the pace of which Iâ€™m getting things done this week. I only conducted one user testing per day, which in reality I could be all done in one day.</p>
        
        <p>What actions will I take for the next sprint:</p>
        
        <p>I will finish my creative media strategy, prepare for my WIP presentation, finish my Type Brief poster, and get started on my case study.</p>
