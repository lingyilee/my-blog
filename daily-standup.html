        <p>What did I accomplish yesterday?</p>

        <p>I jotted down notes of the syllabus for this semester and printed out the briefs, so that I can stick them on my wall at home as a reminder of the expected timeline for completing the various aspects of the new briefs.</p>

        <p>What will I do today?</p>

        <p>Sit and think about what are some suitable social enterprise ideas I can use and actually find people in real life to interview about.</p>
