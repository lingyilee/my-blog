        <p>Daily Standup Questions (28/04/26)</p>
         
        <p>What did I accomplish yesterday?</p>

        <p>Nothing specific to design, as I was still on semester break.</p>

        <p>What will I do today?</p>

        <p>Attend class and take note of what is required for the new briefs.</p>

        <p>Daily Standup Questions (29/04/26)</p>
         
        <p>What did I accomplish yesterday?</p>

        <p>I jotted down notes of the syllabus for this semester and printed out the briefs, so that I can stick them on my wall at home as a reminder of the expected timeline for completing the various aspects of the new briefs.</p>

        <p>What will I do today?</p>

        <p>Sit and think about what are some suitable social enterprise ideas I can use and actually find people in real life to interview about.</p>

        <p>What did I accomplish yesterday?</p>

        <p>I sat and thought about the briefs.</p>

        <p>What will I do today?</p>

        <p>Probably start Googling and reading about what existing social enterprises exist that relate to the Asian New Zealand community, as I think this would be an area that interests me and one that I actually have access to interviewees.</p>

        <p>Daily Standup Questions (01/05/26)</p>
         
        <p>What did I accomplish yesterday?</p>

        <p>I found a bunch of organisations and companies that cater to the Asian community, specifically in regards to the arts, which is in the realm of my interests.</p>

        <p>What will I do today?</p>

        <p>I will start jotting down virtual post-it notes on my Figjam board about these organisations and see if there are any common links among them. I think this would also be a good way to find out what is missing from the current market.</p>

        <p>Daily Standup Questions (02/05/26)</p>
         
        <p>What did I accomplish yesterday?</p>

        <p>I started brainstorming on my Figjam and made a lot of notes about other potential social enterprise ideas. I also did further research on my primary idea and found a couple more companies that specialise in representing Asian artists.</p>

        <p>What will I do today?</p>

        <p>Start formalising my problem statement and check with Simon or Melody on it.</p>
