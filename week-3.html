        <p>Weekly Retrospectives Questions</p>

        <p>Week 3</p>

        <p>What went well:</p>
        
        <p>A lot of things. I'm almost finished with my lo-fi prototype in Figma and animated my Type Here poster in After Effects. Everything went relatively smoothly.</p>
        
        <p>What didn't go well:</p>
        
        <p>I tried to code my poster so that when I hover my cursor over each individual letter it triggers the animation, but I have completely failed at that.</p>
        
        <p>What can be improved:</p>
        
        <p>My coding skills.</p>
        
        <p>What actions will I take for the next sprint:</p>
        
        <p>I will need to finish my lo-fi prototype and get started and finish my stylescapes in time for the presentation.</p>
