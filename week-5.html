        <p>Daily Standup Questions (26/05/25) Monday</p>
         
        <p>What did I accomplish yesterday?</p>

        <p>I had a look at revising my logos, since Melody suggested that I refine it a bit more. I browsed Pinterest for inspiration and found some abstract shapes that I liked which I thought could convey the look a of photo frame as the main silhouette of the new logo.</p>

        <p>What will I do today?</p>

        <p>I will start drawing up some more potential logos in Illustrator and ask for feedback. I plan on using the two images that Melody sent me as inspiration and a starting point, then start developing my own shapes using the photo frame idea./p>

        <p>Are there any blockers?</p>

        <p>No.</p>

        <p>Daily Standup Questions (27/05/26) Tuesday</p>
         
        <p>What did I accomplish yesterday?</p>

        <p>I drew a bunch of new logos in Illustrator using more abstract ideas and played around with the colour combinations. I think the muted lilac and bright orange work best together, since they are somewhat contrasting but also aren’t as stark as using black and white for example. I’ve tried adding accents of my secondary colours of blue and yellow in the logos too, but I feel like I should stick to just two to not complicate things.</p>

        <p>What will I do today?</p>

        <p>I will decide on a final logo and put the brand guideline overview together.</p>

        <p>Are there any blockers?</p>

        <p>No.</p>

        <p>Daily Standup Questions (28/05/26) Wednesday</p>
         
        <p>What did I accomplish yesterday?</p>

        <p>I finalised my logo and put together the brand guideline overview.</p>

        <p>What will I do today?</p>

        <p>I will finish probably finish prototyping my hifi prototype and see if there is anything I need to refine about it. The search and subscribe bars look a bit odd to me at the moment, so I will need to look up what common ones actually look like online to get some idea of how I could change them to make them look more harmonious with the rest of the homepage.</p>

        <p>Are there any blockers?</p>

        <p>No.</p>

        <p>Daily Standup Questions (29/05/26) Thursday</p>
         
        <p>What did I accomplish yesterday?</p>

        <p>I finished my hifi prototype and made sure everything was working the way I want it to. I also learnt that you can make a component and just copy and paste that to every frame to save time on linking the separate pages, which I didn’t know about before, so that saved me a lot of time.
        </p>

        <p>What will I do today?</p>

        <p>I want to start coding my Type Here poster, so I will get started on that. I had a look at some code online for how to make an image go wavy and it seems doable, so I will get started on doing that.</p>

        <p>Are there any blockers?</p>

        <p>No.</p>

        <p>Daily Standup Questions (30/05/26) Friday</p>
         
        <p>What did I accomplish yesterday?</p>

        <p>I finished my Type Here poster. The waves don’t look as smooth as I initially wanted them to, but I actually kind of like the frame by frame effect it gives off.</p>

        <p>What will I do today?</p>

        <p>I feel kind of under the weather today and I have gotten most of what I want to get done this week, so I might just tweak my poster a bit and call it a day.</p>

        <p>Are there any blockers?</p>

        <p>My potential cold that I am getting to making me feel slow and lethargic.</p>

        <p>Weekly Retrospectives Questions</p>

        <p>Week 5</p>

        <p>What went well:</p>
        
        <p>Prototyping the hifi website took a lot less time than I anticipated, since I figured out how to make a component, which I can’t believe that I had no idea about before this week. Also, the poster is coming together nicely, and I am happy with the outcome.</p>
        
        <p>What didn't go well:</p>
        
        <p>I had to revise my logo and I had some trouble thinking up novel ideas for it. I am quite literal by natural and don’t often make quick associations when I am dreaming up ideas, so it was a bit hard for me to think of ways to make meaning out of abstract shapes and relate it to my enterprise idea. However, I am happy that I changed my logo in the end, because I think the new one is more contemporary and scalable in size.</p>
        
        <p>What can be improved:</p>
        
        <p>I think after finding out how to make a component in Figma, I realised that there are lots of small tricks that I am not aware of that could improve my workflow by a lot, so if I have spare time this weekend or next week, I want to watch more YouTube tutorials on Figma. There are a lot of free resources out there on the internet, so I want to make the most out of it while I am still a student and probably have not only more time, but also enthusiasm to learn.</p>
        
        <p>What actions will I take for the next sprint:</p>
        
        <p>I want to start my user testing for my website with at least three people on Tuesday or Wednesday before the WIP presentation, and also put together my slides for it. I also want to get feedback on my poster from also at least three people to see how they will interact with it.

            The term is nearing its end and I’m almost halfway through my time at MDS, so I think it’s also time that I started putting together a portfolio. I will do this after the WIP meeting though.
