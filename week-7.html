        <p>Weekly Retrospectives Questions</p>

        <p>Week 7</p>

        <p>What went well:</p>
        
        <p>I made very steady slow progress on my work.</p>
        
        <p>What didn't go well:</p>
        
        <p>I feel like I could have gotten a lot more work done at a much faster pace, but because of my illness I just didnâ€™t feel very much in the zone when working.</p>
        
        <p>What can be improved:</p>
        
        <p>I think just blocking out each hour and writing down a list of things to do in each day and also in order would help me organise the workload better, rather than get flustered and overwhelmed by the amount of work I still have to do.</p>
        
        <p>What actions will I take for the next sprint:</p>
        
        <p>I will finish my creative media strategy, prepare for my final presentation, and start and finish my case study.</p>
