        <p>Daily Standup Questions (28/04/26)</p>
         
        <p>What did I accomplish yesterday?</p>

        <p>Nothing specific to design, as I was still on semester break.</p>

        <p>What will I do today?</p>

        <p>Attend class and take note of what is required for the new briefs.</p>

        <p>Daily Standup Questions (29/04/26)</p>
         
        <p>What did I accomplish yesterday?</p>

        <p>I jotted down notes of the syllabus for this semester and printed out the briefs, so that I can stick them on my wall at home as a reminder of the expected timeline for completing the various aspects of the new briefs.</p>

        <p>What will I do today?</p>

        <p>Sit and think about what are some suitable social enterprise ideas I can use and actually find people in real life to interview about.</p>

        <p>Daily Standup Questions (30/04/26)</p>
         
        <p>What did I accomplish yesterday?</p>

        <p>I sat and thought about the briefs.</p>

        <p>What will I do today?</p>

        <p>Probably start Googling and reading about what existing social enterprises exist that relate to the Asian New Zealand community, as I think this would be an area that interests me and one that I actually have access to interviewees.</p>

        <p>Daily Standup Questions (01/05/26)</p>
         
        <p>What did I accomplish yesterday?</p>

        <p>I found a bunch of organisations and companies that cater to the Asian community, specifically in regards to the arts, which is in the realm of my interests.</p>

        <p>What will I do today?</p>

        <p>I will start jotting down virtual post-it notes on my Figjam board about these organisations and see if there are any common links among them. I think this would also be a good way to find out what is missing from the current market.</p>

        <p>Daily Standup Questions (02/05/26)</p>
         
        <p>What did I accomplish yesterday?</p>

        <p>I started brainstorming on my Figjam and made a lot of notes about other potential social enterprise ideas. I also did further research on my primary idea and found a couple more companies that specialise in representing Asian artists.</p>

        <p>What will I do today?</p>

        <p>Start formalising my problem statement and check with Simon or Melody on it.</p>

        <p>Weekly Retrospectives Questions</p>

        <p>What went well:</p>

        <p>Even though it was pointed out that my idea for the Social Enterprise brief has already been done in real life before, I feel like just deciding on something and doing research for it has helped me get my feet off the ground.
            Now, I plan on refining my area of interest for my social enterprise and start looking at tackling it from an alternative perspective, as Melody suggested.</p>

        <p>What didn't go well:</p>

        <p>I feel like after taking a two week break from tapping into my inner design brain, I have become slower at thinking and coming up with novel ideas. This is, again, probably because I haven't utilised that part of my brain in a hot minute.
            I also haven't accomplished my sprint goal yet, because I have been utilising my time doing other things, such as socialising, so I haven't spent the alocated time doing the required work.
            Also, I have only just put together my plan for this week and the rest of this semester yesterday, so I haven't exactly been following a plan yet.
        </p>

        <p>What can be improved:</p>

        <p>I think just having a clearer and more defined timeline will help me distribute my time in a more efficient way.
            I have learn that having small daily goals that are realistic and doable is vital to serving the bigger picture, which in this case is finishing this assignment/brief to a standard that I am proud of.</p>

        <p>What actions will I take for the next sprint:</p>

        <p>I will try to accomplish every daily task that I set for myself on time and see if it is realistic or not for me to keep up with.</p>
